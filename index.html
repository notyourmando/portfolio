    <h2>My name is Armando Robledo</h2>

    <div class="spacekitty">
      <p>Space Kitty <span class="live"></span><br />
      <small>I made Space Kitty for my 6 year old daughter who is kindergarten. The purpose of the app was to help her learn and enjoy math. I plan to add subtraction into the program and eventually, multiplication and division.<br> <strong><a href="https://notyourmando.github.io/project1/index.html">Let's Play!</a></strong></small></p>

    <div class="weatherbuddy">
      <p>Weather Buddy <span class="live"></span><br />
      <small>I co-created Weather Buddy in order to have my own personalized weather app. It was fun making AJAX calls with the Forecast.io and Google Maps Geocoding APIs.<br><strong><a href="http://weatherbuddy.herokuapp.com/accounts">Check the weather!</a></strong></small></p>

      <p>ChiStreetArt <span class="live"></span><br />
      <small>Chistreetart was created to catalogue the history of installations and commissioned walls through crowd sourced entries, allowing you to follow the transition of these communal art spaces.<br><strong><a href="http://chistreetart.herokuapp.com/">View the art!</a></strong></small></p>
